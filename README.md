Human Activity Recognition with Smartphones Classifier
In this module, Naïve Bayes, MaxEnt, and Support Vector classifiers will be fitted to the Human Activity Recognition with Smartphones dataset. The objective is to select a metric to score the quality of the classifiers and justify the choice of metric in the context of a specific problem that the data would address.

Once the metric is chosen, the performance of the three classifiers will be compared, and the classifier that achieves the highest scores will be indicated. Speculation will also be made as to why this might be the case, given our knowledge of the dataset.

Finally, contingency tables and plots of the ROC curve for each classifier will be provided. This will help us determine the strengths and weaknesses of each classifier for our specific dataset.

Tasks:
1 - The dataset identified above will be fitted with Naïve Bayes, MaxEnt, and Support Vector classifiers.

2 - A metric will be selected to score the quality of the classifiers, and the choice of metric will be justified in the context of a specific problem that the data would address.

3 - The classifier that achieves the highest scores will be indicated, and speculation will be made as to why this might be the case, given our knowledge of the dataset.

4 - Contingency tables and plots of the ROC curve for each classifier will be provided.

5 - The strengths and weaknesses of each classifier for our specific dataset will be indicated.

Metric Choice and Justifiction:

The metric choice and justification for the models will be to use precision, recall, and F1 score. This will allow model performance (true/false positives and negatives) to be compared within classes and across models.
